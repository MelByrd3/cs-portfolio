    A BATHING APE was a japanese luxury street closthing brand created by NIGO, 
    who works as a DJ, fashion entrepreneur, and producer. The BAPE look spread
    amongst the teenage community in Japan, and this made NIGO's small shop of 
    litte variations of clothing, into a well known, world wide clothing company. 
    NIGO has won an a Japanese MTV style award for his clothing line, and till 
    this day still makes much profit off of the clothing that was made for the 
    individuals loyal to the street.
