    <p>
        Vindinum is an AI progamming game that has you controlling 
        your own Artifical Intelligence character, as you collect mines, 
        regenerate on health, and attack other Artifical Intelligence 
        characters controlled by other users. The goal of the game is to 
        make sure that your AI has the most gold by the game's end, 
        and the only way to claim coins, is by either taking free mines, 
        or also by stealing enemy mines. Since this is a turned based game, 
        the 1200 moves are shared amongst all 4 AI characters, each character 
        having 300 moves.

        THE CODING I'VE USED

        var task;
        task = "freemines"
        task = "taverns"

    <p2>  
        This code is the code that is used to list the tasks that are needed to 
        be done if they were needed. All of the tasks are captured in a variable 
        named task, and this because all of the tasks are their own independent 
        variable and the best way to label that is by grouping them as a group 
        instead of having them as seprate variables.

    <code>
        if(bot.yourBot.life <= 10){
            task = "taverns";
        }
        else if(enemyBots.life <= 10){
            task = "attackenemy";
        }
        else if(bot.yourMines <=1/2){
            task = "stealmines"
        }
        else {
            task = "freemines";

        </pre>
    <div class = "explainations">
    <p3>
        This code talks about how my bot does his actions in the specific order 
        I put it in. It says that if my bot's life is 10 or under 10, I must go 
        to a tavern to refuel on health. If that is not the case, my bot will 
        attack another bot whos helath is, or is under 10. The other command my 
        bot has is to steal any mines if there are mines that need stealing in 
        order to make my coins while taking away other bot's coins. My final 
        command for my bot, is to take freemines that aren't already owned. 
        Trouble that I have within this code is that freemines is my bot's last 
        priority, but if the task of freemines were to move higher in the "else 
        if" list, it would become a higher priority for my bot.

            var closestMine = bot.freeMines[0];
            for( i = 0; i < bot.freeMines.length; i++) {
                if(bot.findDistance(myPos, closestMine) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.freeMines[i])) {
                    closestMine = bot.freeMines[i];
                }
            }
            console.log("Claiming a Free Mine!");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestMine);

    <div class = "explainations">
    <p4>
        This code is telling my bot what exactly to do, when gathering freemines 
        is needed to be done. If gathering freemines needs to be done, my code 
        tells my bot to look for the closest mine and to walk to it. When the 
        walking is done, the code tells my bot take any freemines that are up 
        for grabs. There is also a variable within this patch of code, and that 
        is because the variable "closestMine" needs to be identified to help 
        move the bot to the area of the closest mine.

        Once the my health is on 10 or under 10, this command gets cued, and this 
        code tells my bot exactly what to do if my health is on or under 10. The 
        code refers to my bot, and says that he will need to go to a tavern in
        order to heal up. This patch of code includes the code "myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestTavern)",
        and that part of code means that the direction my bot will be taking will 
        be towards the closest tavern. Once at the tavern, the code of "for(i = 0; i < bot.Taverns.length; i++)" 
        says that my bot will have to refuel on health once at the tavern.

        This patch of code is a simple way for asking the bot to attack an enemy
        if they're closest to you. It will find the other bot by using the "X" and "Y" 
        coordinates in order to find the position of the other bot. Once done, 
        the code says to attack the bot closest to my location. I use the variable
        of "enemyBots" to help my bot identify enemy bots around me, and just like 
        the other two commands, this command says to find path to the enemy bot 
        instead of a unclaimed mine or tavern.

        This final code is the "steal mine" command that tells my bot to steal 
        any mines that are owned by another bot. This patch of code also follows 
        the other three commands, but sadly, I haven't fully finshed my code 
        for this portion of my bot yet. Once the coding for this patch of my AI's
        JavaScript is done, I hope to be able to take mines from enemies as one 
        of the last priorities. I also feel like getting this code correct will 
        make my bot more effective all around.
