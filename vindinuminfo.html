    <p>
        Vindinum is an AI progamming game that has you controlling 
        your own Artifical Intelligence character, as you collect mines, 
        regenerate on health, and attack other Artifical Intelligence 
        characters controlled by other users. The goal of the game is to 
        make sure that your AI has the most gold by the game's end, 
        and the only way to claim coins, is by either taking free mines, 
        or also by stealing enemy mines. Since this is a turned based game, 
        the 1200 moves are shared amongst all 4 AI characters, each character 
        having 300 moves.

        This code talks about how my bot does his actions in the specific order 
        I put it in. It says that if my bot's life is 10 or under 10, I must go 
        to a tavern to refuel on health. If that is not the case, my bot will 
        attack another bot whos helath is, or is under 10. The other command my 
        bot has is to steal any mines if there are mines that need stealing in 
        order to make my coins while taking away other bot's coins. My final 
        command for my bot, is to take freemines that aren't already owned.

        This code is telling my bot what exactly to do, when gathering freemines 
        is needed to be done. If gathering freemines needs to be done, my code 
        tells my bot to look for the closest mine and to walk to it. When the 
        walking is done, the code tells my bot take any freemines that are up 
        for grabs.

        Once the my health is on 10 or under 10, this command gets cued, and this 
        code tells my bot exactly what to do if my health is on or under 10. The 
        code refers to my bot, and says that he will need to go to a tavern in
        order to heal up.

        This code is a simple code for attacking an enemy if their health is 
        or is under 10. It will find the other bot by using the "X" and "Y" 
        coordinates in order to find the position of the other bot. Once done, 
        the code says to attack the person needed to be attacked and ended.

        This final code is the "steal mine" command that tells my bot to steal 
        any mines that are owned by another bot. I haven't fully finshed my code 
        for this portion of my bot yet, but I hope to solve the issues I am 
        having with the "steal mines" command.
