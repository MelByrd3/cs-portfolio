    <h4>
    What is HTML/CSS?
    </h4>
    <div id="selfpaid">
    <p>
    HTML/CSS is the basics of website designing, HTML being the
    actual website, and CSS being the actual designing. These are
    the basics of all of website desinings and these are the basic
    of all types of coding. Out of both HTML and CSS I like doing
    CSS more because CSS is mostly the movement, color, and style
    in pages. In this class, we learn how to make HTML and CSS pages
    and also learn how to express ourselves by using the creation of
    websites. I think this a very productive and cool, and I feel
    like I could invest my time in outside of school and in my future.

    HTML or HyperText Markup Language is what is used to input text within websites that are
    in a website being created from scratch. The HTML basically
    refers to the title of the website, the paragraphs that are held
    in the website, the headers of those paragraphs, etc. In order
    to use HTML, angle brakets are oftenly used to in put commands
    that make text show up on the actual website screen. The HTML
    coding language is very easy to learn and with the proper 
    commitment, could be mastered within a few days.

    CSS is an abriviation for Cascading Style Sheet which is
    the styling of pages to make your bebsite look more appealing
    to the veiwer's eyes. All the colors, backgrounds, boxes,
    sizes and types of font that you see on the website were made
    from CSS coding and was put in between "style" angle brakets
    that confirm that what's going on is for the style of the 
    website. Personally, I think that coding CSS is more difficult
    than coding HTML becasue it is more complex, and an example 
    of something difficult for a first timer in CSS can be dealing
    with text shadow and making the colors of the page blend
    together by coding colors into the text and borders. I feel
    that if coding is fun for you you can excel at being a website designer.
